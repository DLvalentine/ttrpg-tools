E.g. can't have contents -> sack -> {one, two, three} that are all nested. I don't think I'll ever need it, and it seems to me like that is a data design issue. Either new tables need to be made, or maybe ease off the randomness

tools-libs/random-tables/random-tables.js:// TODO Using console.dir for displaying the results of the roll. It's fine for me, but maybe one day it'd be nice to expose some richer presentation options. printf style or something, idk
tools-libs/random-tables/random-tables.js:// TODO if I plan to use this with further projects (UNE or Mythic GME tool?), we should not assume we want to load from manifest by default
tools-libs/random-tables/random-tables.js:// TODO ^ if that's done, we probably want to expose loadTablesFromManifest and loadTable, too, and remove `tables` - which would require usage updates
ttrpg-tools.js:// TODO: Would be nice to have mythic gme tools as their own lib. 
ttrpg-tools.js:// TODO: same as above, but with other tools like UNE.
ttrpg-tools.js:let rl = readline.createInterface({ input, output, prompt: '>' }); // TODO > prompt, history would be nice to have (prompt doesn't seem to work here?)
ttrpg-tools.js:    // FIXME: we should check to make sure this file exists before continuing
ttrpg-tools.js:    // FIXME: see above
ttrpg-tools.js:    // TODO: 9 times out of 10 I want to open or view the file after generating it, maybe have explorer open when we're done? or ask user if they want that?
