# manifest.yaml
# Used to hold the paths to tables that can be loaded into random-tables.js
# TODO would be nice to have a concept of ondemand/load-time if we end up with a sufficiently large number of tables

# paths
# Used to create anchors that point to table paths. Default is ./tools-libs/random-tables/data/tables/ that should exist in the same directory as manifest. If you want to break them up...
# ...say, into monster/loot/etc., you could create a new anchor like so:
#
# monster &monsterTablePath: 
#   path: "./tools-libs/random-tables/data/tables/monsters/"
#
# For usage in tables structure like so
# tables:
#   tableName:
#     <<: *monsterTablePath
#     filename: filename # extension is implied in client code
#     hidden: [true/false] # (optional) whether or not to load this table *at all*, will be treated as false in client code if not included in table def
paths:
  base: &basePath 
    path: "./tools-libs/random-tables/data/tables/"

# tables
# Structure mapping the internal name of the table and its path, filename, and any other optional properties.
tables:
  _template:
    <<: *basePath
    filename: _template
    hidden: true # Unless I'm working on developing new features for random-table, this table should be hidden
  devLoot:
    <<: *basePath
    filename: devLoot
