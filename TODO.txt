tools-libs/random-tables/random-tables.js:// TODO: display style? would be cool to display things instead of dumping the table. Could use YAML's multi-line string thing and add the field like so: [result] to "inject" it
tools-libs/random-tables/random-tables.js:// TODO: printf formatting in tables? Should that be another flag? Should that just be the multi-line thing I describe above?
tools-libs/random-tables/random-tables.js:// TODO: plural nested rolls are especially bad, but not horrible. I think they could benefit most from this.
tools-libs/random-tables/random-tables.js:                // TODO / NOTE: I think this only allows for one nested roll, too. I need to fix that.
tools-libs/random-tables/random-tables.js:                // TODO / NOTE: I think a similar problem exists with quantity, too. If I have multiple plural how do I resolve quantity? Another flag?
tools-libs/random-tables/random-tables.js:                // TODO: Will want to update docs for: nested_, plural, and quantity if/when I fix this
tools-libs/random-tables/random-tables.js:                        // TODO / NOTE: plural currently only affects the first nested field. probably need to go the plural_field route and verify that way, in the event that you have multiple plural nested fields
tools-libs/random-tables/random-tables.js:                        // TODO: I'll take care of that once I get caught up on documentation
tools-libs/random-tables/random-tables.js:// TODO if I plan to use this with further projects (UNE or Mythic GME tool?), we should not assume we want to load from manifest by default
tools-libs/random-tables/random-tables.js:// TODO ^ if that's done, we probably want to expose loadTablesFromManifest and loadTable, too, and remove `tables` - which would require usage updates
ttrpg-tools.js:// TODO: Would be nice to have mythic gme tools as their own lib. 
ttrpg-tools.js:// TODO: same as above, but with other tools like UNE.
ttrpg-tools.js:let rl = readline.createInterface({ input, output, prompt: '>' }); // TODO > prompt, history would be nice to have (prompt doesn't seem to work here?)
ttrpg-tools.js:    // FIXME: we should check to make sure this file exists before continuing
ttrpg-tools.js:    // FIXME: see above
ttrpg-tools.js:    // TODO: 9 times out of 10 I want to open or view the file after generating it, maybe have explorer open when we're done? or ask user if they want that?
