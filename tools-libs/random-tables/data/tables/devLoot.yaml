  name: (Dev) Loot
  description: Test table containing loot rewards
  diceString: d1 # only one possible value, for testing
  exposed: [description, contents, quantity]
  dependencies: [devGems]
values:
  - roll: 1
    # TODO document change: toplevel flags are no more
    # TODO test rich composition: sack of loot: [1, 4] rolled gems, 2 rolled junk, 1 rolled weapon
    # TODO test rich composition: ^ but two sacks, then ^ but [1, 4] sacks
    # TODO test rich composition and document: contents is an array
    contents: # $t|devGems # TODO: document array style ['$t|devGems:2', '$t|devGems'] # TODO document change: string tokens
      a: $t|devGems # TODO document object style, ensure it is noted that I only support a depth of one for now. E.g. can't have contents -> sack -> {one, two, three} that are all nested. I don't think I'll ever need it, and it seems to me like that is a data design issue. Either new tables need to be made, or maybe ease off the randomness
      b: A gun
      c: $t|devGems:[1, 2]
    quantity: 1 # TODO document change: toplevel quantity behaves the same, has no impact on field nested rolls
