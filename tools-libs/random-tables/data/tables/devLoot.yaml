    # TODO update template

    # contents: # $t|devGems # TODO: document array style ['$t|devGems:2', '$t|devGems'] # TODO document change: string tokens
    #   a: $t|devGems # TODO document object style, ensure it is noted that I only support a depth of one for now. E.g. can't have contents -> sack -> {one, two, three} that are all nested. I don't think I'll ever need it, and it seems to me like that is a data design issue. Either new tables need to be made, or maybe ease off the randomness

    quantity: 1 # TODO document change: toplevel quantity behaves the same, has no impact on field table rolls
