  diceString: d1 # only one result, for testing
  properties: [description, result]
  dependencies: [devGems] # TODO need to document this: can either be array of filenames in same path, or list of dependency objects: {tablename, filename, path} of which only two (tablename and path) are really required

values:
  - roll: 1
    flags: [nested_result] # TODO Would be neat if we had a flag that rolled the nested table "quantity" times. E.g. if we roll gems, and the quantity is 2, roll that table twice, don't just give the same result twice. Flag because that might not be desired default behavior
    result: devGems
    # todo: add quantity "special" field, that either accepts a single quantity, or a range (like rolls) and rolls the quantity
