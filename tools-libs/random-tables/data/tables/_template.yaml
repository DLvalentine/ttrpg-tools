info:
  name: Template Table # Display name: what will be shown to user when listing tables
  description: To be used to demonstrate usage of random-tables.js # Short description of what the table does or is for
  diceString: d6 # Valid formatted dice string to be used by dice.js when rolling against this table. We don't necessarily need it, but it adds a layer of reliability to your data. We could have used a d2 here, but wanted to show off ranges below.
  exposed: [result] # Exposed fields of `table` below, that you wish to have returned from the table roll. `roll` should generally be left out of this list.
values:
  - roll: 1 # Value to be compared against to select the result
    result: Some Result # Whatever you want it to be. Right now this is a string. Additional fields to be added at your discretion
  - roll: [2, 6] # Similar to single rolls, but this should be a range. E.g. if a 2, 4, 5, or 6 is rolled, we will get this result
    result: Some Ranged Result
