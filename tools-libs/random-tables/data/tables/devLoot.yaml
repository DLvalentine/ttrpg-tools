# devLoot.yaml
# Test data for "nested tables" feature
# TODO playing around with possible changes to nested/plural/quantity

info:
  name: (Dev) Loot
  description: Test table containing loot rewards
  diceString: d1 # only one possible value, for testing
  exposed: [description, contents, quantity]
  dependencies: [devGems]
values:
  - roll: 1
    flags: [nested_contents, plural] # proposed change: require plural to be plural_<field>.
    contents: devGems
    quantity: [1, 4]
    # proposed change, which I think will work similar to how we have it now:
    # quantity: 1
    # or 
    # quantity [1, 4]
    # or
    # quantity:
    #  - <field>: <1 or [1,4]>
    # ORRRRRR get rid of flags altogether and turn these fields into objects tbh contents = {value: <table>, quantity: <1 or [1,4]>}. Maybe would have been cleaner, but this becomes harder to maintain imo
